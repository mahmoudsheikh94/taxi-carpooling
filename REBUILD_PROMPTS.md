## üìã Usage Instructions

1. **Sequential Execution**: Execute phases in order - each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Complete Prompts**: Copy the entire prompt for each phase, including requirements and context
3. **Verification**: Test functionality after each phase before proceeding
4. **Customization**: Modify requirements based on specific needs
5. **Environment**: Ensure you have necessary API keys (Google Maps, Supabase)

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Create these environment variables during Phase 1:

```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Google Maps
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Optional
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173

## üìù Notes

- Each phase should take 1-2 hours to complete
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next phase
- Keep the existing database schema from the analysis as reference
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design throughout
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode for better code quality

This rebuild approach ensures a clean, modern, and maintainable codebase with proper architecture from the start.
