## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Run full diagnostic
./scripts/troubleshoot-deployment.sh

# Check specific issue
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
```

#### Environment Issues
```bash
# Validate environment variables
grep "^VITE_" .env

# Test environment loading
npm run build:vercel
```

#### Deployment Issues

git remote -v
```

### Interactive Troubleshooting
Run the troubleshooting script for guided issue resolution:
```bash
./scripts/troubleshoot-deployment.sh
```

---

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
Set up automated health checks:
```bash
# Add to crontab for regular monitoring
*/5 * * * * /path/to/scripts/health-check.sh --json >> health-log.json
```

### Deployment Verification
After each deployment:
```bash
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### Continuous Integration
The scripts integrate with GitHub Actions for automated deployments. See `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD configurations.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use different keys for different environments
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage and set quotas

### Repository Security
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Enable Dependabot security updates
- Configure security scanning

### Deployment Security
- Use HTTPS for all environments
- Configure security headers
- Enable CSP policies
- Regular security audits
