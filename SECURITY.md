## Security Measures

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with Supabase Auth
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for database access control
- **Session management** with secure token handling
- **Multi-factor authentication** support (planned)

### 🛡️ Data Protection

- **Environment variable validation** for sensitive configuration
- **Input sanitization** and validation using Zod schemas
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries

### 🔒 Security Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** for HTTPS enforcement
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME-type sniffing

### 🎯 Frontend Security

- **XSS prevention** through React's built-in protections
- **Secure cookie handling** for authentication tokens
- **CSRF protection** through SameSite cookie attributes
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Security

- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency vulnerability monitoring** with Dependabot
- **Code quality gates** to prevent insecure code deployment
- **Regular security updates** for dependencies

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
3. **Keep your browser updated** for latest security patches
4. **Log out from shared devices** and public computers
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

### For Developers

1. **Follow secure coding practices**
2. **Validate all user inputs**
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Review security implications** of code changes

## Vulnerability Categories

- **Secret detection** with TruffleHog
- **License compliance** checking

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing** (periodic)
- **Code reviews** for security implications
- **Security architecture reviews**
- **Threat modeling** for new features

## Incident Response

### Detection
- **Automated monitoring** with Sentry error tracking
- **Log analysis** for suspicious patterns
- **User reports** of security issues
- **Third-party security notifications**

### Response Process
1. **Assessment** - Evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Containment** - Limit the exposure and prevent spread
3. **Eradication** - Remove the vulnerability and threats
4. **Recovery** - Restore services and monitor for issues
5. **Lessons Learned** - Document and improve processes

### Communication
